## 📁 Project Overview

### 🎲 1. Dice Simulation
- **Purpose:** Simulate rolling a six-sided die 1000 times and analyze the results.
- **Features:**
  - Counts of each number rolled (1 through 6)
  - Percentage calculation for each outcome
  - Identifies the most and least frequently rolled numbers
- **Libraries:** NumPy

---

### 📊 2. Statistical Calculator
- **Purpose:** A command-line tool to compute common statistical metrics.
- **Available Calculations:**
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Standard Deviation
  - Variance
  - Maximum and Minimum values
- **How It Works:** The user inputs numbers via the terminal and selects the desired operation.
- **Libraries:** NumPy

### 🧑‍🎓 3. Student Grade Analysis
- **Purpose:** Collect and analyze grades of students across multiple subjects.
- **Features:**
  - Input multiple students and class names
  - Calculate average grade per student
  - Identify the best-performing student
  - Determine the hardest and easiest subject based on average scores
- **Libraries:** NumPy

### 🖼️ 4. Image Processor
- **Purpose:** Perform basic operations on a grayscale image using NumPy.
- **Image Manipulations:**
  - Invert image colors
  - Brighten image
  - Darken image
  - Resize image
  - Crop image (zero out part of it)
- **Display:** All modified images are visualized using `matplotlib`.
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib
